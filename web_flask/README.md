Web Frameworks

A web framework is a collection of tools and libraries that streamline web application development. It provides a foundation for building common web application features without reinventing the wheel each time.
Building a Web Framework with Flask

Flask is a lightweight but powerful web framework for Python. Here's an overview of building a simple Flask app:

Installation: Ensure you have Python (version 3 recommended) and pip (package manager) installed. Use pip install Flask to install Flask.

Create a Flask App:

Create a Python file (e.g., app.py).
Import the Flask class and create an app instance:
Python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Define Routes:

Use the @app.route() decorator to map URLs to functions (called views) that handle requests:
Python
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Run the App:

Use app.run(debug=True) to start the development server and reload your app automatically when changes are detected:
Python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Routes in Flask

A route is a URL pattern that maps to a specific function in your Flask app. It determines how the server responds to incoming requests based on the URL.
Routes can be simple paths (e.g., /) or more complex patterns using regular expressions (/user/<username>).
Handling Variables in Routes

You can capture variables from the URL using placeholders within the route definition:

Python
@app.route("/user/<username>")
def profile(username):
    return f"<h1>Hello, {username}!</h1>"
Use code with caution.
content_copy
The <username> part becomes a variable accessible within the profile function.
Templates

Templates are HTML files that define the overall structure and layout of your web pages. They can contain placeholders for dynamic content.
Flask uses the Jinja2 templating engine.
Creating an HTML Response with a Template

Create a Template:

Create an HTML file (e.g., templates/index.html).
Use Jinja2 syntax to define placeholders:
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, {{ title }}!</h1>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.
content_copy
{{ title }} is a placeholder for dynamic content.
Pass Data to the Template:

In your Flask view, render the template and pass data to the placeholders:
Python
@app.route("/")
def home():
    title = "Flask Tutorial"
    return render_template("index.html", title=title)
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Dynamic Templates

Jinja2 templates support control flow statements (if, for) and loops for dynamic content generation.

HTML
{% if user_logged_in %}
    <p>Welcome back, {{ username }}!</p>
{% else %}
    <p>Please log in.</p>
{% endif %}

<ul>
{% for post in posts %}
    <li>{{ post.title }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Displaying Data from a MySQL Database

Connect to MySQL: Use a database library like MySQLdb or mysql-connector-python to establish a connection.
Execute Queries: Fetch data using SQL queries and store the results in Python data structures (lists, dictionaries).
Pass Data to the Template: Make the data available in your Flask view function and pass it to the template when rendering it.
